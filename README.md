# ShoeLace
Android ShoeLace library

### Description
ShoeLace is a library for easy communication between your mobile and wearable apps.
By specifying a `@Lace` annotation on some of the methods, you basically define a communication
pattern, which is usually implemented with a lot of boilerplate code and which is almost always
the same - create a GoogleApiClient, attach Wear listeners and a lot of callback interfaces and
then start sending Assets (`DataApi`) or Messages (`MessagesApi`).

With ShoeLace this is all just a few lines of code ahead. The GoogleApiClient gets created
automatically and you can concentrate on writing an awesome app.
